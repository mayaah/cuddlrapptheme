              <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
              <a class="question" href="#faq">What is Cuddlr?</a>
              <div class="content">Cuddlr is a location-based social-meeting app just for cuddling. It's a way of finding people near you who are up for a cuddle, without any pressure or expectation. When you and another person decide to have a cuddle, the app gives you live-updating walking directions to each other, so you can meet up. </div>
              <a class="question" href="#faq">What was the inspiration for Cuddlr?</a>
              <div class="content">Our culture doesn't have a space for closeness without pressure. The way we talk about meeting and sharing space and contact with someone assumes that it's centered explicitly around sex and dating, or based on the kind of affection a parent might show a child. We're not getting the right type of contact often enough; we don't give and get enough hugs. Hooking up is certainly not always a bad thing, but there's definitely an under-explored time and a place for a more gentle, no-pressure intimacy, and that's what Cuddlr aims to help with.</div>
              <a class="question" href="#faq">How does Cuddlr work?</a>
              <div class="content">It finds the closest cuddlers in walking distance and shares their first name, picture, and successful and problematic past cuddles (if any). Tap to request a cuddle from a specific person or respond to someone else's request. If you both agree, you can shoot them a brief message like "let's meet at the park" or "I'm wearing a green shirt". Cuddlr will then show real-time walking directions between the two of you. Once you meet and have a cuddle, you can give a thumbs-up if everything went ok, or in the event of a somewhat too-grabby cuddle, you can report the user. That's it! The app also lets you share a picture of the cuddle, and, when you're ready, you can ask for another cuddle through Cuddlr. </div>
              <a class="question" href="#faq">What's the difference between Cuddlr and certain popular "hook-up" apps?</a>
              <div class="content">Many features, such as chat, photo albums, shared interests and likes, can keep users from actually meeting: they just chat for months, or swipe left-or-right, or send photos. On Cuddlr, you get together straight away, have a little cuddle, and then part ways. If you want to hang out again, you can exchange information then and there— but you already know what kind of cuddles they give. </div>
              <a class="question" href="#faq">How do you build in trust and safety measures?</a>
              <div class="content">For potential cuddlers, you can see how many successful and unsuccessful cuddles they've had in the past. Users with a substantial proportion of reports are unlikely to have their requests accepted, and we ban anyone who is consistently using it improperly. In addition, we don't share your location until you've indicated that you do actually want to cuddle this person, and you can block anyone if you don't want them to even see you on the app.</div>
              <a class="question" href="#faq">Do I have a choice about who I cuddle?</a>
              <div class="content">Of course you do! Only cuddle with people who you think you'll enjoy cuddling with. Remember, it takes two to cuddle, so simply being on the service won't sign you up for cuddles. Also, you can block anyone you don't want to see or hear from. Blocking is always mutual: you won't see them, they won't see you. </div>
              <a class="question" href="#faq"> Can I set preferences or filters, for instance for gender or age?</a>
              <div class="content">Not currently. We encourage you to consider cuddling with people who you wouldn't date, sleep with, or even find attractive— as well as those you would. For that reason, while you can scroll past anyone or decline their cuddle requests, and you can block individuals, we do not have built-in filters for categories of people. </div>
              <a class="question" href="#faq">Why do I need to log in with Facebook or Twitter?</a>
              <div class="content">Lots of people ask us "Why do I need to use Facebook or Twitter to log into Cuddlr? Why can't I log in with email? And, why can't I upload my own photos?" The answer is simple: Time. We're a very, very small team. If we let you log in with email, we have to let you upload photos. And if we let you upload photos, some people (this is the internet, of course) will upload inappropriate photos. And then who's going to go through and weed out all the inappropriate ones? We'd have to. And we'd rather spend that time developing new features like enhanced chat and better privacy controls. Maybe someday we'll grow big enough to have some poor intern on pic-checking duty, and then you can log in using whatever you like. For now, though, please accept our apologies for only having two login methods. </div>
              <a class="question" href="#faq">When is Cuddlr coming out for Android? Windows Phone? BlackBerry? Palm Pilot? Desktop?</a>
              <div class="content">We're working right this very moment on an Android version with a planned release date in early 2015. We may bring the app to other platforms after this, but right now we're focusing on adding features to the iOS version and getting the Android version released. You can sign up below if you want to hear when Android (or any other platform) gets added. </div>

                How we protect your personal information
                We take security measures to help safeguard your personal information from unauthorized access and disclosure. However, no system can be completely secure. Therefore, although we take steps to secure your information, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information, chats, or other communications will always remain secure. Users should also take care with how they handle and disclose their personal information and should avoid sending personal information through insecure email. Please refer to the Federal Trade Commission's website at http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/menus/consumer/data.shtm for information about how to protect yourself against identity theft.

                <br>
                Information you provide about yourself while using our Service
                We provide areas on our Service where you can post information about yourself and others and communicate with others. Such postings are governed by our Terms of Use . Also, whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information on publicly-viewable pages, that information will be publicly available and can be collected and used by others. For example, if you post your email address, you may receive unsolicited messages. We cannot control who reads your posting or what other users may do with the information you voluntarily post, so we encourage you to exercise discretion and caution with respect to your personal information.
                <br>
                <br>

                No Rights of Third Parties
                This Privacy Policy does not create rights enforceable by third parties or require disclosure of any personal information relating to users of the website.
                <br>
                <br>
                Changes to this Privacy Policy

</li><li>Arbitration and Governing Law.<br>
a.  The exclusive means of resolving any dispute or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement (including any alleged breach thereof) or the Service shall be BINDING ARBITRATION administered by the American Arbitration Association. The one exception to the exclusivity of arbitration is that you have the right to bring an individual claim against the Company in a small-claims court of competent jurisdiction. But whether you choose arbitration or small-claims court, you may not under any circumstances commence or maintain against the Company any class action, class arbitration, or other representative action or proceeding.<br>
b.  By using the Service in any manner, you agree to the above arbitration agreement. In doing so, YOU GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO GO TO COURT to assert or defend any claims between you and the Company (except for matters that may be taken to small-claims court). YOU ALSO GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR OTHER CLASS PROCEEDING. Your rights will be determined by a NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR, NOT A JUDGE OR JURY. You are entitled to a fair hearing before the arbitrator. The arbitrator can grant any relief that a court can, but you should note that arbitration proceedings are usually simpler and more streamlined than trials and other judicial proceedings. Decisions by the arbitrator are enforceable in court and may be overturned by a court only for very limited reasons. For details on the arbitration process, see our Arbitration Procedures.<br>
c.  Any proceeding to enforce this arbitration agreement, including any proceeding to confirm, modify, or vacate an arbitration award, may be commenced in any court of competent jurisdiction. In the event that this arbitration agreement is for any reason held to be unenforceable, any litigation against the Company (except for small-claims court actions) may be commenced only in the federal or state courts located in Dallas County, Texas. You hereby irrevocably consent to the jurisdiction of those courts for such purposes.<br>
d.  This Agreement, and any dispute between you and the Company, shall be governed by the laws of the state of Texas without regard to principles of conflicts of law, provided that this arbitration agreement shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act.<br>
</li><li>Indemnity by You. You agree to indemnify and hold the Company, its subsidiaries, and affiliates, and its and their officers, agents, partners and employees, harmless from any loss, liability, claim, or demand, including reasonable attorney's fees, made by any third party due to or arising out of your breach of or failure to comply with this Agreement (including any breach of your representations and warranties contained herein), any postings or Content you post in the Service, and the violation of any law or regulation by you. The Company reserves the right to assume the exclusive defence and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you, in which event you will fully cooperate with the Company in connection therewith.<br>
</li><li>Notice. The Company may provide you with notices, including those regarding changes to this Agreement, using any reasonable means now known or hereafter developed, including by email, regular mail, SMS, MMS, text message or postings in the Service. Such notices may not be received if you violate this Agreement by accessing the Service in an unauthorised manner. You agree that you are deemed to have received any and all notices that would have been delivered had you accessed the Service in an authorised manner.<br>
</li><li>Entire Agreement; Other. This Agreement, with the Privacy Policy and any specific guidelines or rules that are separately posted for particular services or offers in the Service, contains the entire agreement between you and the Company regarding the use of the Service. If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid, the remainder of this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect. The failure of the Company to exercise or enforce any right or provision of this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. You agree that your online account is non-transferable and all of your rights to your profile or contents within your account terminate upon your death. No agency, partnership, joint venture or employment is created as a result of this Agreement and you may not make any representations or bind the Company in any manner.<br>
</li><li>Amendment. This Agreement is subject to change by the Company at any time.<br>
